
Note :: you can use ::
         #1) producer => rabbitmq
         #2) consumer => rabbitmq
      OR #1) producer => kafka
         #2) consumer => kafka
      OR #1) producer => rabbitmq
         #2) consumer => kafka
      OR #1) producer => kafka
         #2) consumer => rabbitmq
 Only you have to remember that where you will put rabbitmq or kafka then respective broker(rabbitmq or kafka) should
 be in running state . That is the beautiful part of the spring cloud stream .
